  1. coffee-brewing-guide.md - A comprehensive guide covering different coffee brewing methods, equipment, and techniques
  2. understanding-websockets.md - A technical overview of WebSocket protocol, use cases, and implementation patterns
  3. space-exploration-history.md - A historical overview of humanity's journey into space from early rockets to modern missions

This is a new node project in an empty directory.
